# Forum Threading Error Fix

## Issue Description
User reported "Error loading threads" when trying to access forum functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `getCourseForumThreads()` API method in `api.service.ts`. The method was trying to perform LEFT JOINs on fields that don't exist in the database schema:

### Problems Found:
1. **Missing Creator Fields**: The API was trying to JOIN on `course_forum_threads.creator_teacherid` and `course_forum_threads.creator_studentid`, but these fields don't exist in the `course_forum_threads` table according to the Prisma schema.

2. **Incorrect Field References**: The method was referencing non-existent creator fields in the GROUP BY clause.

3. **Wrong Date Field**: Using `created_at` instead of `createdAt` (camelCase vs snake_case).

## Database Schema Reality
According to the Prisma schema, the `course_forum_threads` model has:
- `id` (primary key)
- `threadid` (unique string)
- `courseid` (foreign key to courses)
- `title`
- `body`
- `isPinned`
- `isLocked`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

**Note**: Creator information is stored at the POST level (`course_forum_posts` table), not at the thread level.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `getCourseForumThreads()` method:
- Removed non-existent creator JOINs
- Simplified selectors to only include existing fields
- Fixed date field reference from `created_at` to `createdAt`
- Maintained the Object.assign pattern for consistency with getCourses format

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Forum Component:
- Added console logging for debugging
- Better error messages
- Null checks for API responses
- Course ID extraction validation

### 3. Fixed API Method Structure:
```typescript
const postObject = {
  selectors: [
    'course_forum_threads.*',
    'courses.Course as course_title', 
    'courses.ID as course_id',
    'COUNT(course_forum_posts.id) as post_count'
  ],
  tables: 'course_forum_threads',
  conditions: Object.assign(
    {
      'LEFT JOIN courses': 'ON course_forum_threads.courseid = courses.ID',
      'LEFT JOIN course_forum_posts': 'ON course_forum_threads.id = course_forum_posts.threadId AND course_forum_posts.isDeleted = false',
      WHERE: whereObject,
      'GROUP BY': 'course_forum_threads.id, courses.Course, courses.ID',
      'ORDER BY': 'course_forum_threads.isPinned DESC, course_forum_threads.createdAt DESC'
    },
    limitObject
  )
};
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ API method structure matches getCourses pattern
- ✅ Database schema alignment verified

## Next Steps
1. Test the forum functionality in the browser
2. Verify that classes load correctly
3. Confirm that threads display when a class is selected
4. Check console logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/services/API/api.service.ts` - Fixed getCourseForumThreads method
2. `src/app/components/shared/forum/forum.component.ts` - Enhanced error handling and debugging

## Impact
This fix should resolve the "Error loading threads" issue and allow users to properly access forum functionality for both teachers and students.

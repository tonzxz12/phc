### 4. **Role-Based Permissions**

#### **Teachers Can:**

#### **Students Can:**

### 5. **Navigation Integration**
- Forum has been added to both student and teacher sidebars
- Routes configured for both user types:
  - `/student/forum` - Student forum access
  - `/teacher/forum` - Teacher forum access
  - `/student/forum/thread/:id` - Thread detail view for students
  - `/teacher/forum/thread/:id` - Thread detail view for teachers

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created/Modified

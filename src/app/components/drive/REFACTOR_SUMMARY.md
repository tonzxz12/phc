# Drive Dashboard - Refactored Structure

## Overview
The drive dashboard has been refactored to use a modular component structure for better organization and maintainability.

## Component Structure

### 1. Drive Layout Component (`drive-layout`)
- **Location**: `src/app/components/drive/drive-layout/`
- **Purpose**: Main layout container that orchestrates the sidebar, header, and body components
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages sidebar open/close state
  - Handles communication between components
  - Provides the overall layout structure

### 2. Drive Sidebar Component (`drive-sidebar`)
- **Location**: `src/app/components/drive/drive-sidebar/`
- **Purpose**: Navigation sidebar with menu items and user actions
- **Features**:
  - My Files, Recent, Trash navigation
  - Collapsible/expandable sidebar
  - Logout functionality
  - Responsive design with mobile support

### 3. Drive Header Component (`drive-header`)
- **Location**: `src/app/components/drive/drive-header/`
- **Purpose**: Top header with breadcrumbs, search, and user controls
- **Features**:
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Notification icon
  - User profile picture
  - Mobile menu button

### 4. Drive Body Component (`drive-body`)
- **Location**: `src/app/components/drive/drive-body/`
- **Purpose**: Main content area displaying files and folders
- **Features**:
  - Search functionality
  - Grid/List view modes
  - File operations (open, share, download, delete)
  - Context menus
  - Upload progress
  - Empty states
  - Mock data support for testing

### 5. Drive Dashboard Component (`drive-dashboard`) - Updated
- **Location**: `src/app/components/drive/drive-dashboard/`
- **Purpose**: Entry point component that uses the layout
- **Simplified**: Now just handles authentication and uses the layout components

## Usage

The drive dashboard now uses the layout structure:

```html
<app-drive-layout>
  <app-drive-body></app-drive-body>
</app-drive-layout>
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify individual components
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones

## Component Communication

- **Sidebar → Layout**: Emits sidebar toggle and view change events
- **Layout → Body**: Passes current view state
- **Body**: Handles its own state and file operations

## Styling

Each component has its own CSS file with:
- Responsive design
- Modern Google Drive-like UI
- Dark/light theme support (prepared)
- Mobile-first approach

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `drive-layout.component.ts/html/css`
- `drive-sidebar.component.ts/html/css`
- `drive-header.component.ts/html/css`
- `drive-body.component.ts/html/css`

### Modified Files:
- `drive-dashboard.component.ts/html/css` (simplified)
- `app.module.ts` (added new component declarations)

## Next Steps

1. Test the refactored components
2. Implement real API integration in the body component
3. Add routing for different views
4. Implement file upload/download functionality
5. Add proper error handling and loading states

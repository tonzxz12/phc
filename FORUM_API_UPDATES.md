# Forum API Methods Updated - Following getCourses Format

## âœ… **Updated API Methods in `api.service.ts`**

I have successfully updated all the forum CRUD methods to follow the same structure and format as your `getCourses` method. Here are the key changes:

### **1. New Methods Added:**

#### **`getTeacherClassesForForum()`**
- Gets teacher's classes with course information and statistics
- Follows the same format as `getCourses` with proper JOIN statements
- Returns class data with enrolled student count and thread count

#### **`getStudentClassesForForum()`**
- Gets student's enrolled classes with course information
- Uses proper JOIN statements for student_classes, classes, and courses
- Returns class data with course title and thread statistics

### **2. Updated Methods:**

#### **`getCourseForumThreads(courseId?, limit?)`**
- Now uses `Object.assign()` pattern like `getCourses`
- Proper LEFT JOIN statements with correct table aliases
- Added creator information (teacher/student names)
- Uses consistent field naming (FirstName, LastName, etc.)
- Proper GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses

#### **`getCourseForumThreadById(threadId)`**
- Updated to include creator information
- Uses proper JOIN syntax consistent with your format
- Returns complete thread data with course and author details

#### **`getCourseForumPosts(threadId, limit?)`**
- Follows the `getCourses` structure with `Object.assign()`
- Proper LEFT JOIN statements for students and teachers
- Uses consistent field naming (FirstName, LastName, Profile)
- Includes reply count and proper grouping

#### **`createCourseForumThread(data)`**
- Added creator tracking (creator_studentid, creator_teacherid)
- Uses proper user data from `getUserData()`
- Maintains data integrity for forum ownership

### **3. Updated Forum Component:**

#### **`forum.component.ts`**
- Updated `loadClasses()` to use new methods:
  - `getTeacherClassesForForum()` for teachers
  - `getStudentClassesForForum()` for students
- Fixed `loadThreads()` to use proper course ID field mapping
- Updated route navigation to use correct user-type paths
- Added proper error handling with snackbar notifications

### **4. Key Improvements:**

#### **Consistent Data Structure:**
- All methods now follow the same pattern as `getCourses`
- Uses `Object.assign()` for condition building
- Proper handling of optional parameters (limit, filter)
- Consistent field naming across all queries

#### **Better JOIN Management:**
- LEFT JOIN statements follow your established pattern
- Proper table aliasing and field selection
- Consistent GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses

#### **Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Added proper error messages with `failedSnackbar()`
- Consistent error logging and user feedback

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works Now:**

### **For Teachers:**
1. `getTeacherClassesForForum()` loads teacher's classes with statistics
2. `getCourseForumThreads(courseId)` loads threads for selected class
3. Proper creator tracking shows who created each thread

### **For Students:**
1. `getStudentClassesForForum()` loads student's enrolled classes
2. Forum shows threads from classes they're enrolled in
3. Proper permissions for viewing and creating content

### **Data Format Consistency:**
All methods now return data in the same format as your `getCourses` method:
- Proper JOIN relationships
- Consistent field naming
- Standardized error handling
- Compatible with your existing UI components

## âœ… **Build Status:**
- Project builds successfully with no compilation errors
- All forum components properly integrated
- TypeScript types are consistent
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

The forum system now follows your established patterns and should work seamlessly with your database structure and UI components!
